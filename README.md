# Slides on Incorrectness Logic

These are slides based on [Prof. Peter O'Hearn's POPL'19 Paper on Incorrectness Logic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3371078), presented over two 1.5-hour lectures for the course [COL731: Advanced Compiler Techniques](https://iitd.github.io/col731/) offered by Prof. Sorav Bansal at IITD in Sem I, 2023-24.

The slides do not cover Section 5 of the paper because we decided to skip it in class. Most of the content borrows from the paper, except a few new examples, typo-fixes and reorganisation. I am deeply grateful to Prof. O'Hearn for writing a clear, accessible and interesting paper (and of course, for the content in these slides).
